I'm a second-year undergraduate Computer Science student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

I grew up in Jaipur and did my schooling and coaching from Jaipur itself. I learned about `JAVA`, `MySQL` and `HTML` from the school curriculum itself!

My personal interests are app development, programming, movies, volleyball, badminton, and my favorite mobile games.

Currently, I am a member of Mobile Development Group, IIT Roorkee in which I am working on different applications and their related stuff. Also involved in conducting lectures and workshops for the newbies to mobile app development.
