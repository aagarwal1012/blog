I'm a first year undergraduate Computer Science student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

I grew up in Jaipur and did my schooling and coaching from Jaipur itself. I learned about `JAVA`, `MySQL` and `HTML` from the school curriculum itself!

My personal interests are android development, programming, movies, badminton and my favorite mobile games.

Currently, I am working in NSS Sponsorship Cell, IIT Roorkee in which we had met many sponsors for the various events.
