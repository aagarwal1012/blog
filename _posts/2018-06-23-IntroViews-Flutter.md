IntroViews is inspired by [Paper Onboarding](https://github.com/Ramotion/paper-onboarding-android) and developed with `love` from scratch. I decided to rewrite almost all the features in order to make it available to the `flutter` developers and extensible as possible.

#  Features

- Easy addition of pages.

- Circular page reveal.

- Cool Animations.

- Animation control, if the user stops sliding in the midway.

- Skip button, for skipping the app intro.

- Custom font selection.

- Material Design.

# Getting Started

You should ensure that you add the `intro_views_flutter` as a dependency in your flutter project.

```yaml
dependencies:
 intro_views_flutter: "^1.0.0"
```

You can also reference the git repository directly if you want:

```yaml
dependencies:
 intro_views_flutter:
   git: git://github.com/aagarwal1012/IntroViews-Flutter
```

You should then run `flutter packages get` in your terminal so as to get the package.

# Usage

- `IntroViewsFlutter` widget require a `list` of `PageViewModel` , and some other parameters. Refer the code below to create a PageViewModel page.

  ```dart
  Final page = new PageViewModel(
        pageColor: const Color(0xFF607D8B),
        mainImageAssetPath: 'assets/taxi.png',
        title: 'Cabs',
        body: 'Easy cab booking at your doorstep with cashless payment system',
        iconImageAssetPath: 'assets/taxi-driver.png',
        titleTextColor: Colors.white,
        bodyTextColor: Colors.white,
        iconColor: null,
        titleTextSize: 54.0,
        bodyTextSize: 24.0,
        fontFamily: "MyFont",
        pageTitleBold: false,
        bubbleBackgroundColor: Colors.white,
      );
  ```

- Now refer the code below to get the `IntroViewsFlutter` widget.

  ```dart
  final Widget introViews = new IntroViewsFlutter(
        [page],
        onTapDoneButton: (){
          //Void Callback  
        },
        showSkipButton: true,
        pageButtonFontFamily: "Regular",
        pageButtonsColor: Colors.white,
        pageButtonTextSize: 18.0,
      );
  ```
  For further usage refer the [`example`](https://github.com/aagarwal1012/IntroViews-Flutter/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart) available. <br>

  ***Note :*** If you added more than four pages in the list then there can be overlapping between `page icons` and `skip button`, so my suggestion is just make the `showSkipButton: false`.
